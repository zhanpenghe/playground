# ZP's playground
Welcome to playground! This is a place to hold something that I implement besides working on my research projects. These codes are written for study purpose so there's no guarantee that everything will work perfectly. However, if you find something that is not working, you are always welcomed to file an issue and discuss with me. Currently I just started two projects so there aren't many things to see here. Please feel free to come back to check them out!

## Projects
* [RNN](rnn/): I decided to write some rnn blocks from scratch to explore more in recurrent neural network.
* [Graph Nets](graph_nets/): An pytorch implementation of graph_nets.
